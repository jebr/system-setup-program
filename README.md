## DOWNLOAD

[DOWNLOAD EXE HERE](https://github.com/jebr/SSP/releases/)

**Note:** Windows Defender may report the EXE as a trojan (Win32/Pocyx.C!cl), and may therefore prevent you from extracting the EXE to anywhere on your computer. Set up an exclusion in **Settings > Update & Security > Windows Defender > Exclusions** by adding the folder you intend to extract the EXE to.

## How to Use

**You need to run it as administrator.**

Just follow the instructions in the help section.
